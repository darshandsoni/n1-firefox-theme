# N1 Firefox Theme
The N1 Firefox theme is a Firefox inspired theme for the [Nylas N1](https://nylas.com/) Email client. 
This theme uses the Taiga theme as a starting base. Thanks to noahbuscher for extensive documentation on variable names.

## Usage
1. Download this project.
2. In Nylas N1, go to `N1>Preferences>General>Select Theme`. Select `Install new theme`. Select this project folder.
3. If you don't already have it, get the open-source [Fira Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Sans) font made for Firefox. - *This step is optional but recommended for good posterity.*
4. Refresh N1, put your feet up and bask with the fox.
